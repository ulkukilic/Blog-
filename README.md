# Blog Management System

The Blog Management System is a modern web-based blog platform built with PHP, MySQL, and Tailwind CSS. It provides comprehensive tools for managing blog content, including adding posts, bulk content import, database backups, and user email verification.
This project was created specifically to learn how to import data from Excel files and transfer it into the database. This allows multiple blog posts to be added quickly and securely at once.
